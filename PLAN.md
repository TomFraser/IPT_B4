# Development
### Idea
* Make an web application / application that can be used to determine the availability of a classroom and help with room changes and class room classifications
* The app will be a web based service that staff (and to some extent studes) can access and update classroom timetables

### How the idea will be developed
* The idea will take advantage of **flask** for **python**, **html**, **css** and other web based tools such as **javascript** and **node.js**.

### Database design
* The database will contain many tables that are arranged to contain information about the type of classroom, the teacher using the classroom at a certain time, the class being held in the classroom and further information such as room changes information.

### Why this is being developed
* The current system the school uses is unclear about when students have room changes. The system also makes it difficult for staff memebers to allocate or request classrooms for special occasions or exams. This web based application will help aid staff to orgainise classrooms.

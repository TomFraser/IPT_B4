## Stage 1 - Identification

#### Preamble

Classroom allocation can often be a difficult and messy process for both teachers and students of an educational institute such as Brisbane Boys' College. As the current system stands, there is a break in communication between teachers and students in this regard. Often room changes are never communicated to students leading to wasting time with students scrambling to find their new classroom.

#### Solution

The solution to the identified problem is to conceve, design and build a web based application using Python and Flask that allows teachers to create, modify and alert students to room changes. The solution must be capable of allowing teachers to request room changes, confirm room changes while giving a reason and to notify students via either email or integration with schoolbox, the primary web tool used at the school.
